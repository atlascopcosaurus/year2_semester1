In Java, **data abstraction** and **encapsulation** are two core concepts in object-oriented programming, each serving a different purpose for managing complexity and protecting data.

### 1. Data Abstraction
**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows users to work at a high level, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. This is typically achieved through abstract classes or interfaces in Java.

For example, consider a `Car` class. When we drive a car, we only need to know how to start, stop, accelerate, and brake. We donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally or how the braking system is designed. Abstraction helps in achieving this by exposing only the necessary operations to the user.

#### Example of Abstraction:
```java
abstract class Car {
    abstract void start();
    abstract void stop();
}

class Tesla extends Car {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Tesla started");
    }

    @Override
    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Tesla stopped");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Tesla();
        myCar.start();
        myCar.stop();
    }
}
```

Here, the `Car` class is abstract and hides the implementation details of `start()` and `stop()` methods. We know we can start and stop a car, but we don't know how it happens internally.

### 2. Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** is the technique of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class. Encapsulation also involves restricting access to certain details of an object, protecting the data from unauthorized access or modification. This is done by declaring the class fields as `private` and providing public `getter` and `setter` methods to access and modify them if needed.

#### Example of Encapsulation:
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // private variable to protect direct access

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance > 0) {
            balance = initialBalance;
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() { // Getter to access balance
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) { // Method to modify balance
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
        account.deposit(500);
        account.withdraw(300);
        System.out.println("Current balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

Here, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the `balance` field, making it accessible only through `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance` methods. The `balance` field cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class, providing a controlled way to manage data.

### Summary of Differences

| Aspect             | Data Abstraction                                               | Encapsulation                                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | To show only the essential features, hiding unnecessary details.| To bind data and methods together and restrict direct access.|
| **Focus**          | What an object does                                           | How data is protected and accessed                         |
| **Implementation** | Achieved with abstract classes and interfaces                 | Achieved with `private` fields and `public` getter/setter methods |
| **Example Usage**  | Defining a `Car` interface or abstract class with essential methods | Making `balance` in `BankAccount` private and providing methods to modify it |

Abstraction helps in focusing on high-level operations, while encapsulation is about controlling access to data for security and protection.
