To enhance the code as per your requirements, we can introduce an additional check based on the user's age. The user will be able to choose a loan term based on the maximum age limit of 65. The program will calculate the maximum possible loan term by subtracting the user's current age from 65. The user will then be prompted to input a loan term within this range.

Here's the updated code that includes age validation for the loan term:

### Updated Java Code

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

// Base Loan class (abstraction and inheritance)
public abstract class Loan {
    protected double loanAmount;
    protected int loanTerm; // in years
    protected double interestRate;

    public Loan(double loanAmount, int loanTerm) {
        this.loanAmount = loanAmount;
        this.loanTerm = loanTerm;
        setInterestRate(); // Interest rate is set by the bank for each loan type
    }

    // Set interest rate - must be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void setInterestRate();

    // Method to calculate monthly payment
    public double calculateMonthlyPayment() {
        int totalMonths = loanTerm * 12;
        double monthlyInterestRate = (interestRate / 100) / 12;
        return (loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, totalMonths)) /
                (Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, totalMonths) - 1);
    }

    // Getter for loan type name - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract String getLoanType();

    // Getter for interest rate to display it to the user
    public double getInterestRate() {
        return interestRate;
    }
}

// Home Loan class (inheritance and polymorphism)
class HomeLoan extends Loan {
    public HomeLoan(double loanAmount, int loanTerm) {
        super(loanAmount, loanTerm);
    }

    @Override
    protected void setInterestRate() {
        this.interestRate = 5.0; // Bank-defined interest rate for home loan
    }

    @Override
    public String getLoanType() {
        return "Home Loan";
    }
}

// Car Loan class (inheritance and polymorphism)
class CarLoan extends Loan {
    public CarLoan(double loanAmount, int loanTerm) {
        super(loanAmount, loanTerm);
    }

    @Override
    protected void setInterestRate() {
        this.interestRate = 6.5; // Bank-defined interest rate for car loan
    }

    @Override
    public String getLoanType() {
        return "Car Loan";
    }
}

// Personal Loan class (inheritance and polymorphism)
class PersonalLoan extends Loan {
    public PersonalLoan(double loanAmount, int loanTerm) {
        super(loanAmount, loanTerm);
    }

    @Override
    protected void setInterestRate() {
        this.interestRate = 8.0; // Bank-defined interest rate for personal loan
    }

    @Override
    public String getLoanType() {
        return "Personal Loan";
    }
}

// Main application class
public class MauriBankLoanCalculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // User inputs
        System.out.println("Welcome to MauriBank Loan Department!");

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String userName = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Check if user age is valid for loan eligibility
        if (age < 18 || age > 65) {
            System.out.println("You must be between 18 and 65 years old to be eligible for a loan.");
            return;
        }

        // Calculate maximum loan term based on age (up to 65 years)
        int maxLoanTerm = 65 - age;

        System.out.println("Hello " + userName + ", please choose a loan type:");
        System.out.println("1. Home Loan");
        System.out.println("2. Car Loan");
        System.out.println("3. Personal Loan");

        int loanChoice = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the loan amount you wish to take: ");
        double loanAmount = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.printf("Enter the loan term in years (maximum %d years): ", maxLoanTerm);
        int loanTerm = scanner.nextInt();

        // Validate the loan term entered by the user
        if (loanTerm <= 0 || loanTerm > maxLoanTerm) {
            System.out.printf("Invalid loan term. You can only repay your loan over a maximum of %d years.%n", maxLoanTerm);
            return;
        }

        Loan loan = null;

        // Determine loan type based on user's choice
        switch (loanChoice) {
            case 1:
                loan = new HomeLoan(loanAmount, loanTerm);
                break;
            case 2:
                loan = new CarLoan(loanAmount, loanTerm);
                break;
            case 3:
                loan = new PersonalLoan(loanAmount, loanTerm);
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid loan type selected. Exiting...");
                return;
        }

        // Display loan details including interest rate and calculate monthly payment
        double monthlyPayment = loan.calculateMonthlyPayment();
        System.out.printf("You have selected a %s with a loan amount of %.2f for a term of %d years.%n",
                loan.getLoanType(), loanAmount, loanTerm);
        System.out.printf("The interest rate applied is: %.2f%%%n", loan.getInterestRate());
        System.out.printf("The monthly payment is: %.2f%n", monthlyPayment);
    }
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Age Input**: The user is prompted to enter their age.
2. **Eligibility Check**: The program checks if the user is between 18 and 65 years old (the valid age range for loan eligibility).
3. **Loan Term Validation**: The maximum loan term is calculated as `65 - age`, meaning the user can choose to repay the loan over a period that doesn't extend beyond their 65th birthday.
4. **Loan Term Input Validation**: If the user enters a loan term that exceeds the maximum allowed term based on their age, the program will notify them and exit.
