Here is the enhanced version of your code with proper input validation for all user inputs using `try-catch` blocks to handle errors and ensure the program runs smoothly without crashing due to invalid inputs.

### Enhanced Java Code with Validation and Error Handling

```java
import java.util.InputMismatchException;
import java.util.Scanner;

// Base Loan class (abstraction and inheritance)
public abstract class Loan {
    protected double loanAmount;
    protected int loanTerm; // in years

        this.loanAmount = loanAmount;
        this.loanTerm = loanTerm;
        setInterestRate(); // Interest rate is set by the bank for each loan type
    }

    // Set interest rate - must be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void setInterestRate();

    // Method to calculate monthly payment
    public double calculateMonthlyPayment() {
        int totalMonths = loanTerm * 12;
        double monthlyInterestRate = (interestRate / 100) / 12;
        return (loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, totalMonths)) /
                (Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, totalMonths) - 1);
    }

    // Getter for loan type name - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract String getLoanType();

    // Getter for interest rate to display it to the user
    public double getInterestRate() {
        return interestRate;
    }
}

// Home Loan class (inheritance and polymorphism)
class HomeLoan extends Loan {
    public HomeLoan(double loanAmount, int loanTerm) {
        super(loanAmount, loanTerm);
    }

    @Override
    protected void setInterestRate() {

    }

    @Override
    public String getLoanType() {
        return "Home Loan";
    }
}

// Car Loan class (inheritance and polymorphism)
class CarLoan extends Loan {
    public CarLoan(double loanAmount, int loanTerm) {
        super(loanAmount, loanTerm);
    }

    @Override

    }

    @Override

    }

// Main application class
public class MauriBankLoanCalculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        try {
            // User inputs
            System.out.println("Welcome to MauriBank Loan Department!");

            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String userName = scanner.nextLine();

            System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
            int age = scanner.nextInt();

            // Check if user age is valid for loan eligibility
            if (age < 18 || age > 65) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("You must be between 18 and 65 years old to be eligible for a loan.");
            }

            // Calculate maximum loan term based on age (up to 65 years)
            int maxLoanTerm = 65 - age;

            System.out.println("Hello " + userName + ", please choose a loan type:");
            System.out.println("1. Home Loan");

                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid loan type selected. Please choose a valid option (1, 2, or 3).");
            }

            System.out.print("Enter the loan amount you wish to take: ");
            double loanAmount = scanner.nextDouble();

            if (loanAmount <= 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Loan amount must be greater than zero.");
            }

            System.out.printf("Enter the loan term in years (maximum %d years): ", maxLoanTerm);
            int loanTerm = scanner.nextInt();

            // Validate the loan term entered by the user
            if (loanTerm <= 0 || loanTerm > maxLoanTerm) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                        String.format("Invalid loan term. You can only repay your loan over a maximum of %d years.", maxLoanTerm));
            }

            Loan loan = null;

            // Determine loan type based on user's choice
            switch (loanChoice) {
                case 1:
                    loan = new HomeLoan(loanAmount, loanTerm);
                    break;
                case 2:
                    loan = new CarLoan(loanAmount, loanTerm);
                    break;
                case 3:
                    loan = new PersonalLoan(loanAmount, loanTerm);
                    break;
            }

            // Display loan details including interest rate and calculate monthly payment
            double monthlyPayment = loan.calculateMonthlyPayment();
            System.out.printf("You have selected a %s with a loan amount of %.2f for a term of %d years.%n",
                    loan.getLoanType(), loanAmount, loanTerm);
            System.out.printf("The interest rate applied is: %.2f%%%n", loan.getInterestRate());

        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter the correct data type.");
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            scanner.close();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Try-Catch Blocks**:
   - **`try`**: The main logic of the program is placed inside the `try` block to handle errors gracefully.
   - **`catch (InputMismatchException e)`**: Catches any mismatch between expected input types (e.g., if the user enters a string where a number is expected).
   - **`catch (IllegalArgumentException e)`**: Handles validation errors, such as invalid age, loan type, loan amount, or loan term.
   - **Error Messages**: The program outputs specific error messages to the user based on the invalid input, making it clear what went wrong.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - **Age**: The age is checked to ensure itâ€™s between 18 and 65 years. If the age is outside this range, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
   - **Loan Type**: The loan type is validated to ensure the user selects a valid option (1, 2, or 3). Any invalid option results in an exception.
   - **Loan Amount**: The loan amount must be greater than zero. If a non-positive amount is entered, an exception is thrown.
   - **Loan Term**: The loan term must be within the range defined by the user's age (i.e., between 1 and `65 - age`). If the term exceeds this range or is less than or equal to zero, the program throws an exception.

3. **Graceful Exit**: 
   - The `finally` block ensures that the scanner is closed properly regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

### Example Outputs:

**Invalid Loan Amount:**
```
Welcome to MauriBank Loan Department!
Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your age: 45
Hello John Doe, please choose a loan type:

```

Enter the loan term in years (maximum 25 years): 30
Invalid loan term. You can only repay your loan over a maximum of 25 years.
```

**Invalid Loan Type Selection:**
