To implement the loan system using **polymorphism** and **inheritance**, we can create a base class `Loan`, from which different types of loans (`PersonalLoan`, `HomeLoan`, `CarLoan`) inherit. We will then use polymorphism to calculate the monthly payment based on the loan type chosen by the user. This approach ensures that common behavior is defined in the base class, and specific loan types override the method for calculating the monthly payment.

### Structure:
1. **Loan Base Class**: The base class containing common properties and methods for all loans.
2. **Concrete Loan Subclasses**: Specific loan types (`PersonalLoan`, `HomeLoan`, `CarLoan`) that extend the `Loan` class and override the calculation logic.
3. **LoanApp Class**: The main class for user interaction.

### Implementation:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

// Step 1: Define the base class Loan
class Loan {
    protected double principal;
    protected double interestRate;
    protected int tenureInYears;

    public Loan(double principal, double interestRate, int tenureInYears) {
        this.principal = principal;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
        this.tenureInYears = tenureInYears;
    }

    // Method to calculate monthly payment (to be overridden in subclasses)
    public double calculateMonthlyPayment() {
        return 0;
    }
}

// Step 2: Define subclasses for each loan type, inheriting from Loan

class PersonalLoan extends Loan {
    public PersonalLoan(double principal, double interestRate, int tenureInYears) {
        super(principal, interestRate, tenureInYears);
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateMonthlyPayment() {
        int months = tenureInYears * 12;
        double monthlyRate = interestRate / 12 / 100;
        return (principal * monthlyRate) / (1 - Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, -months));
    }
}

class HomeLoan extends Loan {
    public HomeLoan(double principal, double interestRate, int tenureInYears) {
        super(principal, interestRate, tenureInYears);
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateMonthlyPayment() {
        int months = tenureInYears * 12;
        double monthlyRate = interestRate / 12 / 100;
        return (principal * monthlyRate) / (1 - Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, -months));
    }
}

class CarLoan extends Loan {
    public CarLoan(double principal, double interestRate, int tenureInYears) {
        super(principal, interestRate, tenureInYears);
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateMonthlyPayment() {
        int months = tenureInYears * 12;
        double monthlyRate = interestRate / 12 / 100;
        return (principal * monthlyRate) / (1 - Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, -months));
    }
}

// Step 3: Main application class
public class LoanApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Welcome to MauriBank Loan Department");
        System.out.println("Choose Loan Type: 1. Personal Loan 2. Home Loan 3. Car Loan");
        int loanChoice = scanner.nextInt();

        // Input loan parameters
        System.out.print("Enter Loan Amount (Principal): ");
        double principal = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter Interest Rate (in %): ");
        double interestRate = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter Tenure (in years): ");
        int tenureInYears = scanner.nextInt();

        Loan loan = null; // Using the base class reference for polymorphism

        // Step 4: Determine loan type using polymorphism
        switch (loanChoice) {
            case 1:
                loan = new PersonalLoan(principal, interestRate, tenureInYears);
                break;
            case 2:
                loan = new HomeLoan(principal, interestRate, tenureInYears);
                break;
            case 3:
                loan = new CarLoan(principal, interestRate, tenureInYears);
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid choice. Exiting.");
                return;
        }

        // Step 5: Calculate and display the monthly payment using polymorphism
        double monthlyPayment = loan.calculateMonthlyPayment();
        System.out.printf("Your monthly payment is: %.2f\n", monthlyPayment);
    }
}
```

### How It Works:
1. **Loan Base Class**: 
   - Contains common properties (`principal`, `interestRate`, `tenureInYears`) and a method `calculateMonthlyPayment`, which is overridden in each subclass.
   
2. **Inheritance**: 
   - `PersonalLoan`, `HomeLoan`, and `CarLoan` extend the `Loan` class and override the `calculateMonthlyPayment` method to provide specific calculation logic.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - In the `LoanApp` class, we declare a `Loan` type reference (`Loan loan`). Depending on the user's choice, it is assigned to a specific subclass (e.g., `new PersonalLoan()`), and the `calculateMonthlyPayment` method is called. The correct subclass method is invoked at runtime (polymorphism).

### Sample Output:

```
Welcome to MauriBank Loan Department
Choose Loan Type: 1. Personal Loan 2. Home Loan 3. Car Loan
1
Enter Loan Amount (Principal): 500000
Enter Interest Rate (in %): 8.5
Enter Tenure (in years): 5
Your monthly payment is: 10237.86
```

### Explanation:
- **Inheritance**: The `PersonalLoan`, `HomeLoan`, and `CarLoan` classes inherit common attributes (`principal`, `interestRate`, `tenureInYears`) from the `Loan` base class, allowing code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: At runtime, the correct method (`calculateMonthlyPayment`) for the specific loan type (e.g., `PersonalLoan`, `HomeLoan`, or `CarLoan`) is called through the base class reference (`Loan loan`).

This design ensures that the application is flexible and adheres to Object-Oriented principles such as **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, making it easier to extend or modify the loan system in the future.
