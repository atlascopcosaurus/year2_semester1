### Answers with Explanations

1. **a. `System.out.println(2 + "bc");`**  
   - **Output:** `2bc`  
   - **Explanation:** `2` is treated as part of a string concatenation with `"bc"`, resulting in `"2bc"`.

2. **b. `System.out.println(2 + 3 + "bc");`**  
   - **Output:** `5bc`  
   - **Explanation:** `2 + 3` is evaluated first, resulting in `5`, which is then concatenated with `"bc"`.

3. **c. `System.out.println((2 + 3) + "bc");`**  
   - **Output:** `5bc`  
   - **Explanation:** The parentheses force `2 + 3` to be evaluated first, resulting in `5`, which is then concatenated with `"bc"`.

4. **d. `System.out.println("bc" + (2 + 3));`**  
   - **Output:** `bc5`  
   - **Explanation:** The expression inside the parentheses `(2 + 3)` is evaluated first, resulting in `5`, and then `"bc"` is concatenated with `5`.

5. **e. `System.out.println("bc" + 2 + 3);`**  
   - **Output:** `bc23`  
   - **Explanation:** `"bc"` is concatenated with `2`, resulting in `"bc2"`, and then `3` is concatenated, producing `"bc23"`.

6. **f. `System.out.println("bc" + (2 + 3) + "a" + 5);`**  
   - **Output:** `bc5a5`  
   - **Explanation:** `(2 + 3)` is evaluated first, resulting in `5`, which is then concatenated with `"bc"`, giving `"bc5"`. The `"a"` is then concatenated, resulting in `"bc5a"`, and finally `5` is concatenated, giving `"bc5a5"`.

7. **g. `System.out.println(5 + "bc" + (2 * 3));`**  
   - **Output:** `5bc6`  
   - **Explanation:** `5` is concatenated with `"bc"`, resulting in `"5bc"`. Then, `(2 * 3)` is evaluated, resulting in `6`, which is concatenated to give `"5bc6"`.

These explanations should clarify the behavior of operator precedence and associativity in Java, especially with the `+` operator for string concatenation and arithmetic operations.
