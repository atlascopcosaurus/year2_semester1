Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts and answers for your assignment content based on object-oriented programming (OOP):

### **Question 1**
- **Statement**: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and serve as a base for derived classes.
- **Answer**: **True**.  
  Abstract classes are designed to provide a blueprint for subclasses. You cannot create an object directly from an abstract class.

---

### **Question 2**
- **Question**: Which of the following is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called by an object or class?
  - **A)** Statement
  - **B)** Function
  - **C)** Method
  - **D)** Variable
- **Answer**: **C) Method**.  
  A **method** is a block of code that performs a specific task and is associated with an object or class in object-oriented programming.

---

### **Question 3**
- **Statement**: A constructor is a special method used for initializing objects, typically used to set initial values for object attributes.
- **Answer**: **True**.  
  Constructors are special methods automatically invoked when an object is created, used for setting up initial values.

---

### **Question 4**
- **Statement**: The superclass is the parent class from which sub-classes inherit properties and methods.
- **Answer**: **True**.  
  The superclass is also referred to as the **parent class**. It passes down properties and behaviors (methods) to subclasses.

---

### **Question 5**
- **Question**: What is the purpose of encapsulation in object-oriented programming?
  - **A)** To define the structure and behavior of an object
  - **B)** To establish relationships between objects
  - **C)** To define the inheritance hierarchy of classes
  - **D)** To hide the internal implementation details of an object and provide a public interface to interact with it
- **Answer**: **D) To hide the internal implementation details of an object and provide a public interface to interact with it**.  
  **Encapsulation** is about restricting direct access to some of an object’s components and only allowing controlled access via public methods.

---

### **Question 6**
- **Statement**: In polymorphism, different objects can be treated as instances of the same class, allowing for code reusability and flexibility.
- **Answer**: **True**.  
  **Polymorphism** enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass, promoting flexibility and reusability.

---

### **Question 7**
- **Statement**: The interface defines a contract that classes can implement, ensuring common behavior across different classes.
- **Answer**: **True**.  
  An **interface** specifies a set of methods that a class must implement, providing a standardized way for different classes to interact.

---

### **Question 8**
- **Statement**: A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called by an object or class.
- **Answer**: **True**.  
  Methods are used to define the behaviors of objects and can be invoked by instances of classes (objects) or directly via the class itself.
