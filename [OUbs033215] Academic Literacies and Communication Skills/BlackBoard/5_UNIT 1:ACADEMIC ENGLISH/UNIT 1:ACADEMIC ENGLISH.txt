WHAT IS ACADEMIC WRITING? In this Unit, you will be introduced to ‘Academic English’. Before using academic English, for written or oral purposes, it is important to differentiate world englishes and to understand the importance of making standard use of English in academic writing and speaking. You will, thus, be exposed to academic reading, writing, listening and speaking examples with the aim of enhancing your skills through appropriate exposure.
