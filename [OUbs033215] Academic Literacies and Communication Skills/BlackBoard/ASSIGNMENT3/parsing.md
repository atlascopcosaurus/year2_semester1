Presentation Content


Objective: To develop a program that parses input sentences, identifies their grammatical components, and visualizes the sentence structure.





You may use a power point for your submission including the parsing code within the presentation.



Instructions:

Familiarize Yourself with the Activity:

Read through the instructions carefully to understand the objective and steps involved in creating the sentence parsing programs.

Choose a Programming Language:

Select a programming language of your choice based on your familiarity and comfort level. Recommended languages include Python, Java, or JavaScript.


Understand the Program Structure:

Review the concept of tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and syntax parsing to understand the foundational principles of the program.


Implement the Parsing Logic:

Write code to tokenize input sentences, identify the part of speech for each word, and determine the grammatical structure of the sentence. Utilize libraries or frameworks such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for Python or Stanford NLP for Java.


Develop an Interactive Interface:

Create a user-friendly interface where users can input sentences and view the parsed results. This could be a command-line interface or a simple web application.


Test the Program:

Test the program with various input sentences to ensure that it accurately identifies and analyzes the grammatical components and sentence structure. Debug any errors or issues encountered during testing.


Optional Enhancements:

Explore additional features or enhancements for the program, such as error handling, support for different languages, or integration with external libraries for natural language processing.


Document Your Code:

Document your code with clear comments and explanations to help others understand the functionality and logic behind your program.


Submit Your Work:

Once you have completed the activity, submit your code along with a brief explanation of your approach and any challenges faced during the development process.
