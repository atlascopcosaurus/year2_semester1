Dear Learners, 

Welcome to the Academic Literacies Module! I am pleased to have you embark on this learning journey with us.

Throughout this module, you will delve into the essential skills and practices that are crucial for success in your academic endeavours. Academic literacies encompass a wide range of abilities, from effective reading and critical thinking to scholarly writing and proper referencing.
