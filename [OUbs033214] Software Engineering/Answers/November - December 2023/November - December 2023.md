   - **Relationships**:
     - Used by one `Light` object.

**Structural Constraints**:
- Each `MotionSensor` can activate only one `Light`.
- Each `MotionSensor` can check only one `LightSensor`.
- Each `Light` uses only one `Timer`.

#### b) Sequence Diagram (13 marks)

To draw the sequence diagram for the given scenario, we'll use the following assumptions:
1. The `MotionSensor` activates the `Light` only if `LightSensor` detects it is not daylight.
2. When the `Light` is turned on, the `Timer` starts.
3. The `Light` turns off after the `Timer` expires.
4. The `MotionSensor` does not activate the `Light` during daylight.

Hereâ€™s the PlantUML code for the sequence diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User

User -> MotionSensor : activate()
MotionSensor -> LightSensor : check()
LightSensor --> MotionSensor : isDark==true
MotionSensor -> Light : turnOn()
Light -> Timer : start()
Timer -> Light : duration expires
Light -> Light : turnOff()

== After Timer expires and it becomes daylight ==

User -> MotionSensor : activate()
MotionSensor -> LightSensor : check()
LightSensor --> MotionSensor : isDark==false
MotionSensor --> Light : No action

@enduml
```
