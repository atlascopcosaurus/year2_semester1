# Course Information (Read before you continue)
## Welcome
Welcome to the “Software Engineering" module.

This module aims to help students appreciate the reality of team-based software development in an industrial environment, with customer needs, budget constraints and delivery schedules to be met. Students will learn the core software engineering concepts that underpin current best practice.  

## Module Structure

We recommend that you go through the module sequentially as it is designed for the optimal learning experience. You should aim to complete all topics by the end of the semester. This course is organised into the following topics:
* Topic 1 • Introduction to Software Engineering
* Topic 2 • Software Processes
* Topic 3 • Requirement Engineering
* Topic 4 • System Modelling
* Topic 5 • Source Code Management
* Topic 6 • Agile Software Development
* Topic 7 • Software Testing
* Topic 8 • Digital Transformation for Software Engineering


## Module Design

The module manual is provided to you as a PDF. Each topic may include reflection activities and knowledge checks to promote further understanding on the topic.

Discussions are an integral portion of the course as they expand your thoughts and help you gain insight from your peers. You will need to first post an original response. Then you will be able to see the responses from other participants.

Some topics contain a test with closed-ended questions. You will have three attempts to pass each test. Your final grade will be a cumulative grade of all the topic tests. You may use outside resources and manuals to answer the questions.

There will be an assignment that you will need to submit.


## Module Grading
Your overall module grade will be calculated based on the following categories:
Discussions: You are expected to participate in each discussion and respond to at least one peer. While these are not graded at an individual level, you will receive a final grade based on your contribution. You are encouraged to participate in all discussion forums in the module and to respond to your classmates.
Test: All topic tests will be combined into a cumulative test grade.
Assignment: You will complete an assignment and receive feedback from the instructor.
Exam: You will be required to sit for a written exam. 
Your progress will display as the overall grade when you view the grade book. Your grade will not be considered final until all activities are graded and complete.


## Facilitation
This module is delivered by an instructor who will post general announcements, grade activities, and monitor discussions. The instructor is also available to answer your questions about this module and its content as you progress through it.
You can contact your instructor by using the Message feature, located on the upper right-hand corner of the main page. You can expect a response from your instructor within 2 business days for any questions and within one week for any graded activities.


## Netiquette Guidelines
Netiquette is etiquette for the Internet: guidelines and good practices for online communication in emails, discussion forums, and chat rooms. Please adhere to the following guidelines when posting comments in our training course:

* Format your text so it is easy to read. Try to use standard paragraph spacing, indentation, and legible font. Try to be consistent with your formatting, including font size, color, etc.
* Be concise and to the point in your communication. Limit discussion forum posts to a few paragraphs. Proofread and edit your work before posting.
* AVOID THE USE OF ALL CAPS as this may be interpreted as shouting. All lowercase letters also make the text more difficult to read. Use standard punctuation. Remember what your teacher taught you in primary school about good punctuation and spelling.
* Avoid 'texting' abbreviations such as OMG.
* Avoid using humor and sarcasm, as they are often difficult to detect in written communication. It is okay to sparingly use emoticons to communicate subtleties or emotions that are more obvious in spoken communication.
* Flaming (posting a rant about someone or some topic) is prohibited in our courses. Practice civil discussion.
* Respect the privacy of communication within a course. Do not forward the comments of classmates to others outside of the course or publish them on social media.
* Stay on topic in a discussion.
* Respect the fact that participants have varying degrees of sensitivity, and that even some well-meaning constructive suggestions (e.g., comments about broken links, typos, misspellings) may be misconstrued as public criticism. Therefore, please refrain from sharing comments in ways that might be misinterpreted, or do so privately when appropriate.
