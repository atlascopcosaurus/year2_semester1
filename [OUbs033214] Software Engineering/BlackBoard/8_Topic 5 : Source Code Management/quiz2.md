### Revision Notes:

#### **Question 1: Purpose of Code Review in Software Development**
- **Purpose**: The goal of a code review is to **identify defects, improve code quality**, and **share knowledge among team members**. 
- Code reviews ensure that the code is thoroughly inspected by peers, leading to early detection of bugs and promoting better collaboration.

#### **Question 2: Definition of 'Branching' in Version Control Systems**
- **Branching**: This refers to the **creation of a copy of the codebase** to work on independent code changes. 
- It allows multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes without interfering with each otherâ€™s progress until the changes are ready to be merged back.

#### **Question 3: Best Practice for Version Control in Software Engineering**
- **Best Practice**: **Using meaningful commit messages** to describe the purpose of the code changes.
- Well-written commit messages make it easier to understand the history of changes, which helps team members track the reasons for each change.

#### **Question 4: Purpose of a 'Merge' in Version Control Systems**
- **Merge**: The purpose is to **integrate changes from one branch into another branch**, combining the work of different developers.
- This is a crucial step in the development process, as it ensures that independent work is consolidated in the main codebase.

#### **Question 5: Definition of a Commit**
- **Commit**: In source code management, a commit represents a **set of changes that are made to the codebase**.
- It is a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time, often accompanied by a message explaining what changes were made.

#### **Question 6: Main Challenge in Software Configuration Management**
- **Main Challenge**: One of the main challenges is **managing conflicts that arise when multiple developers make changes to the same codebase simultaneously**.
- Version control systems help manage these conflicts, but resolving them effectively can be difficult and time-consuming.

#### **Question 7: Purpose of a Version Control System**
- **Purpose**: The main purpose of a version control system is to **keep track of changes to source code and collaborate with a team**.
- It ensures that every change is documented and can be easily reverted if necessary, allowing for collaboration without risking the integrity of the codebase.

#### **Question 8: Version Control Systems and Reverting Code**
- **True**: Version control systems can be used to **revert to previous versions** of source code.
- This feature allows developers to undo changes and restore an earlier version of the code, which is useful in case of mistakes or bugs.
