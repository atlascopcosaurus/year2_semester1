# Question 3

Sure, let's break down and answer each part of the question:

### Question 3 [20 Marks]

#### a) Explain the key differences between Link State routing protocols and Distance Vector protocols and give an example of each. (5 marks)

**Link State Routing Protocols:**
- **Key Concept:** Each router independently maps out the network topology.
- **Method:** Routers use information about the state of each link (i.e., how good or bad a connection is) to create a map of the network. This map is used to calculate the best path to a destination.
- **Updates:** Only when there is a change in the network topology, routers send updates.
- **Examples:** OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System).

**Distance Vector Routing Protocols:**
- **Key Concept:** Routers share information about the distance to destinations with their immediate neighbors.
- **Method:** Each router calculates routes based on the distance (hop count) and direction (vector) to any given destination. The information is shared with neighboring routers.
- **Updates:** Periodically and whenever a change is detected in the topology, all or part of the routing table is sent to all neighbors.
- **Examples:** RIP (Routing Information Protocol), EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).

#### b) Using a diagram, describe how OSPF works, what metric and algorithm this routing protocol uses to find the best path to a destination. (5 marks)

**Explanation:**
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: OSPF uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path tree for each route. The metric used by OSPF is cost, which is based on the bandwidth of the links.

**Diagram:**

1. **Link State Advertisement (LSA) Flooding:**
   - Each router broadcasts its link state to all other routers in the network area.
   
2. **Topology Database:**
   - Each router builds a topology database based on the LSAs received.
   
3. **Shortest Path Tree Calculation:**
   - Using Dijkstra's algorithm, each router calculates the shortest path tree to all destinations.
   
4. **Routing Table:**
   - The shortest path tree is used to populate the routing table with the best paths to each destination.

```
           [Router A]
           /    |    \
       [Router B] [Router C]
       /           /         \
[Router D] [Router E] [Router F]
```

#### c) Using a diagram, describe how BGP routes traffic between different Autonomous Systems. (5 marks)

**Explanation:**
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: BGP is used to exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems (AS). It uses path vector routing and maintains a path (list of AS numbers) to reach a destination.

**Diagram:**

1. **Autonomous Systems (AS):**
   - Each AS is represented by a router or a set of routers.

2. **BGP Peering:**
   - BGP routers establish peering sessions with routers in other ASes.

3. **Path Vector:**
   - BGP advertises the entire path (sequence of AS numbers) to reach a destination network.
   
4. **Decision Process:**
   - BGP routers use path attributes like AS-path length, policy, and other criteria to select the best path.

```
      AS1          AS2          AS3
    [Router]----[Router]----[Router]
       |              |              |
[Network A]   [Network B]   [Network C]
```

#### d) Describe the 3-way handshake protocol for TCP Connection Establishment. (5 marks)

**Explanation:**
- **Step 1: SYN**
  - The client sends a SYN (synchronize) message to the server to initiate a connection.

- **Step 2: SYN-ACK**
  - The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) message to acknowledge the SYN request and to initiate a connection back to the client.

- **Step 3: ACK**
  - The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) message to the server to acknowledge the SYN-ACK, completing the connection establishment.

**Sequence:**
1. **Client â†’ Server:** SYN (Seq=1000)
2. **Server â†’ Client:** SYN-ACK (Seq=2000, Ack=1001)
3. **Client â†’ Server:** ACK (Seq=1001, Ack=2001)

```
  Client                           Server
     |         SYN (Seq=x)     --->    |
     |   <--- SYN-ACK (Seq=y, Ack=x+1) |
     |     ACK (Seq=x+1, Ack=y+1) ---> |
```

**Transmission Process:**
- The transmitter converts electrical data signals into light signals using a light source (laser or LED).
- The light signals are sent through the optical fibre, which guides the light over distances with minimal loss.
- Optical amplifiers may be used to boost signal strength if the distance is very long.
- At the destination, the receiver converts the light signals back into electrical signals using a photodetector.
- The electrical signals are then processed and interpreted by the receiving equipment.
