### a) Briefly explain the functions of each layer of the OSI Reference Model.

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model consists of seven layers, each with specific functions:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
   - **Function:** Handles the physical connection between devices. It deals with the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium (e.g., cables, switches).
   - **Examples:** Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
   - **Function:** Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection and correction. It ensures that data is transferred correctly between two physically connected devices.
   - **Examples:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), MAC addresses.

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
   - **Function:** Manages data routing, forwarding, and addressing between networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.
   - **Examples:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
   - **Function:** Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. It ensures complete data transfer through error recovery and flow control.
   - **Examples:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5):**
   - **Function:** Manages sessions or connections between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
   - **Examples:** NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**
   - **Function:** Translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data encoding, encryption, and compression.
   - **Examples:** SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG, ASCII.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7):**
   - **Function:** Provides network services directly to end-user applications. It facilitates communication between software applications and lower layers.
   - **Examples:** HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
