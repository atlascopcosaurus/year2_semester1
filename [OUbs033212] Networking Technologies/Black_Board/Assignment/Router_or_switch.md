To connect all three branches in a network, the most appropriate device would be a **Router** or a **Layer 3 Switch**. Here's a breakdown of both options:

### 1. **Router**
   - **Purpose:** Routers are used to connect multiple networks and manage traffic between them. In this scenario, a router at each branch will be responsible for routing traffic between the branches.
   - **Why:** 
     - Routers can connect different branches even if they are on different networks or IP subnets.
     - Routers also support **WAN technologies** (like MPLS, VPN, etc.) to connect remote branches over long distances.

   ##### **How to Use:**
   - Each branch will have a router connected to the local network (LAN) through a switch. The routers in each branch will be connected through **WAN links** (e.g., Serial, Ethernet, or VPN tunnels).
   - You will configure routing (static or dynamic, such as OSPF or EIGRP) between the routers to allow communication across the branches.

### 2. **Layer 3 Switch (Multilayer Switch)**
   - **Purpose:** A Layer 3 switch can perform both switching (Layer 2) and routing (Layer 3). This device is typically used for inter-VLAN routing and can route traffic between VLANs or different IP subnets without needing a dedicated router.
   - **Why:** 
     - A Layer 3 switch is useful when the branches are within a **LAN environment** (such as a campus or connected via fast local links) and are part of the same organizationâ€™s network infrastructure.
     - If the branches are geographically close, Layer 3 switches can efficiently handle the routing and switching tasks.

   ##### **How to Use:**
   - Use a Layer 3 switch at each branch to route traffic between VLANs and across branches.
   - Connect the Layer 3 switches of each branch through a **trunk link** or a **WAN link** (Ethernet, fiber, etc.).
   - You would configure **inter-VLAN routing** or **static/dynamic routing protocols** (such as OSPF) between Layer 3 switches.

### **Which Device to Choose?**

- **For Geographically Distant Branches:**
  - If the branches are in different locations (e.g., different cities or countries), you should use **Routers**. Routers can connect to **WAN services** provided by ISPs (e.g., MPLS, VPN, leased lines).
  
- **For Geographically Close Branches:**
  - If the branches are within the same **local network or campus**, you can use **Layer 3 Switches**. Layer 3 switches are faster for internal network communication and can provide both switching and routing functions.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Router Scenario:**
  - Branch 1, 2, and 3 are located in different cities. Each branch has a router that connects to the WAN through a **VPN** or **MPLS** link. Routers handle the routing between the branches.

- **Layer 3 Switch Scenario:**
  - Branch 1, 2, and 3 are located within a campus or in the same local area (like different buildings within a close distance). A **Layer 3 switch** is used in each branch to route traffic between VLANs and to the other branches over a **trunk link**.

### Conclusion:
- **For distant branches:** Use **routers** with WAN connectivity.
- **For local branches:** Use **Layer 3 switches** for efficient internal routing.
