To adapt your network to use the **IP range 192.168.200.0/23** and allocate IPs for **three branches** with the four given departments (**Accounts, Administrator, Marketing, Sales**) based on the specified quantities, you will need to **subnet** the IP range to efficiently allocate IP addresses.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Determine the IP Requirements for Each Department**
You have the following departments with the given number of devices:
- **Accounts**: 59 devices
- **Administrator**: 69 devices
- **Marketing**: 119 devices
- **Sales**: 249 devices

For each department, we need to create subnets that can accommodate at least the specified number of devices, while keeping room for growth and adhering to network best practices.

### 2. **Subnet the Network 192.168.200.0/23**
The IP range **192.168.200.0/23** provides **512 total IP addresses** (including network and broadcast addresses). We can break this down into smaller subnets for each department. Since **/23** provides more than 512 IP addresses, we can work with **/24**, **/25**, **/26**, etc., to divide the network accordingly.

Let’s calculate the required subnets:

| Department     | Qty  | Required Hosts  | Recommended Subnet Mask  | Total Usable IPs  |
|----------------|------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Accounts**    | 59   | At least 62     | **/26** (255.255.255.192) | 62 usable IPs     |
| **Administrator**| 69   | At least 70     | **/25** (255.255.255.128) | 126 usable IPs    |
| **Marketing**   | 119  | At least 126    | **/25** (255.255.255.128) | 126 usable IPs    |
| **Sales**       | 249  | At least 254    | **/24** (255.255.255.0)   | 254 usable IPs    |

### 3. **Subnet Assignment**
Here’s how you can divide the **192.168.200.0/23** network into multiple subnets based on the departments and their requirements:

#### a. **Sales Department (249 devices)**: 
   - **Subnet**: 192.168.200.0/24
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
   - **Usable IPs**: 192.168.200.1 to 192.168.200.254
   - This provides **254 usable IP addresses**, which is enough for 249 devices.

#### b. **Marketing Department (119 devices)**:
   - **Subnet**: 192.168.201.0/25
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.128
   - **Usable IPs**: 192.168.201.1 to 192.168.201.126
   - This provides **126 usable IP addresses**, which is enough for 119 devices.

#### c. **Administrator Department (69 devices)**:
   - **Subnet**: 192.168.201.128/25
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.128
   - **Usable IPs**: 192.168.201.129 to 192.168.201.254
   - This provides **126 usable IP addresses**, which is enough for 69 devices.

#### d. **Accounts Department (59 devices)**:
   - **Subnet**: 192.168.200.128/26
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.192
   - **Usable IPs**: 192.168.200.129 to 192.168.200.190
   - This provides **62 usable IP addresses**, which is enough for 59 devices.

### 4. **Network Overview**
After subnetting, here’s the breakdown:

| Department     | Subnet Address        | Subnet Mask          | Usable IP Range                    | Total Usable IPs |
|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Sales**      | 192.168.200.0/24      | 255.255.255.0        | 192.168.200.1 – 192.168.200.254    | 254              |
| **Marketing**  | 192.168.201.0/25      | 255.255.255.128      | 192.168.201.1 – 192.168.201.126    | 126              |
| **Administrator**| 192.168.201.128/25   | 255.255.255.128      | 192.168.201.129 – 192.168.201.254  | 126              |
| **Accounts**   | 192.168.200.128/26    | 255.255.255.192      | 192.168.200.129 – 192.168.200.190  | 62               |

### 5. **VLAN Configuration for Each Department**
You can now assign each department a VLAN and link it to the corresponding subnet. Here’s how you could assign VLANs to the subnets:

| Department     | VLAN ID  | Subnet Address        |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------|
| **Sales**      | VLAN 10  | 192.168.200.0/24      |
| **Marketing**  | VLAN 20  | 192.168.201.0/25      |
| **Administrator**| VLAN 30| 192.168.201.128/25    |
| **Accounts**   | VLAN 40  | 192.168.200.128/26    |

### 6. **Routing between Branches**
Since you have multiple branches, you'll need to implement **inter-VLAN routing** using a **Layer 3 Switch** or **Router**. The switch or router will route traffic between the VLANs for intra-branch communication, and to the WAN link for inter-branch communication.

### 7. **Sample VLAN and IP Configuration for Core Switch**

```plaintext
! Core Switch Configuration (Assuming Layer 3 switch for routing)
enable
configure terminal
hostname CoreSwitch

! Create VLANs for each department
vlan 10
 name Sales
vlan 20
 name Marketing
vlan 30
 name Administrator
vlan 40
 name Accounts

! Assign IP addresses to VLAN interfaces (SVIs) for inter-VLAN routing
interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.200.1 255.255.255.0  ! Sales Default Gateway

interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.201.1 255.255.255.128  ! Marketing Default Gateway

interface vlan 30
 ip address 192.168.201.129 255.255.255.128  ! Admin Default Gateway

interface vlan 40
 ip address 192.168.200.129 255.255.255.192  ! Accounts Default Gateway

! Enable OSPF (Optional)
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.200.0 0.0.1.255 area 0

! Save configuration
end
write memory
```

### 8. **Connecting the Branches**

For communication between branches, you can establish **VPNs** (for secure connectivity over the internet) or **dedicated leased lines** (for direct communication). If you have a **WAN router** connecting to all three branches, use routing protocols like **OSPF** or **BGP** depending on your WAN setup to ensure smooth routing across branches.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you've:
1. Subnetted the **192.168.200.0/23** network to suit your departmental needs.
2. Assigned **VLANs** for departmental segregation.
3. Set up **inter-VLAN routing** using a Layer 3 device.
4. Provided a scalable and efficient design that fits the current requirements and allows for future expansion.
