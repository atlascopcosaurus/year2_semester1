<p>Here's a draft for the <strong>Introduction</strong> section of your report:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-introduction"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
<h3 id="overview-of-the-case-study"><strong>Overview of the Case Study</strong></h3>
<p>This report details the design and simulation of a network infrastructure for an organization that consists of three branches, each containing multiple departments: Accounts, Administration, Marketing, and Sales. The IP address block <strong>192.168.200.0/23</strong> has been assigned, and the organization requires the allocation of IP addresses and network resources to support <strong>496 devices</strong> across these departments. The case study necessitates the development of a scalable, secure, and efficient network, implemented using <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong>, to simulate the required topology.</p>
<p>The network simulation demonstrates how different departments, ranging in size from <strong>59 to 249 devices</strong>, will be isolated using <strong>VLANs</strong> (Virtual Local Area Networks) and interconnected through <strong>routers and switches</strong> for optimal traffic management. The design is aimed at meeting both the current requirements and allowing for future expansion, ensuring that each branch and department can communicate securely within its own VLAN and across the entire network.</p>
<h3 id="objectives-of-the-network-simulation"><strong>Objectives of the Network Simulation</strong></h3>
<p>The main objective of this network simulation is to provide a detailed design and implementation that addresses the following key goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Departmental Segmentation</strong>: Using VLANs to segment network traffic, ensuring that each department operates within its isolated environment.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-VLAN Communication</strong>: Enabling communication between departments and branches through inter-VLAN routing while maintaining security.</li>
<li><strong>IP Addressing</strong>: Efficient distribution of IP addresses based on department size and ensuring there is enough address space for each department within the <strong>192.168.200.0/23</strong> subnet.</li>
<li><strong>Network Scalability</strong>: Designing the network with scalability in mind, allowing easy expansion of departments or branches without major network overhauls.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation and Testing</strong>: Simulating the network in <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong>, verifying the correctness of the design through connectivity tests, and addressing potential issues such as VLAN trunking and routing.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation and Presentation</strong>: Producing a detailed report and a presentation to explain the design choices, configurations, and the overall performance of the simulated network.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scope-of-the-report"><strong>Scope of the Report</strong></h3>
<p>This report will cover the complete process of designing and simulating the network architecture for the organization. It will provide a thorough analysis of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Addressing Scheme</strong>: Subnetting and IP allocation for different departments based on their device counts.</li>
<li><strong>Network Topology</strong>: The physical and logical layout of the network, including the placement of switches, routers, and connections between them.</li>
<li><strong>Device Configuration</strong>: Configuration of routers and switches, including VLAN creation, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing.</li>
<li><strong>Testing and Simulation</strong>: The process of testing the network’s functionality, ensuring that devices in each department can communicate with each other and with other branches.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong>: Addressing any technical difficulties encountered during the simulation process, such as VLAN misconfigurations or routing issues, and providing solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion and Lessons Learned</strong>: A summary of the overall design, simulation results, and lessons learned throughout the project.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Here’s a draft for the <strong>Network Design Requirements</strong> section of your report:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-network-design-requirements"><strong>2. Network Design Requirements</strong></h2>
<h3 id="ip-addressing-scheme-192168200023"><strong>IP Addressing Scheme (192.168.200.0/23)</strong></h3>
<p>The organization has been allocated the IP address range <strong>192.168.200.0/23</strong>, which provides a total of <strong>510 usable IP addresses</strong>. This address block is large enough to accommodate the current device count across all branches and departments while allowing room for future expansion.</p>
<p>The <strong>/23 subnet mask (255.255.254.0)</strong> provides 512 IP addresses, with the first and last addresses reserved for the network and broadcast addresses, respectively. This leaves <strong>510 usable IP addresses</strong> for allocation across the four departments: <strong>Accounts, Administrator, Marketing, and Sales</strong>. The IP address space will be divided efficiently among the departments, with each department receiving a sufficient number of IP addresses to accommodate their current devices, and additional addresses reserved for scalability.</p>
<h3 id="branch-and-departmental-allocation"><strong>Branch and Departmental Allocation</strong></h3>
<p>The network is segmented into multiple <strong>Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)</strong>, with each department allocated a dedicated VLAN. This ensures network segmentation, security, and improved traffic management. The following allocation has been made based on the device count in each department:</p>
<h4 id="accounts-59-devices"><strong>Accounts: 59 Devices</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>VLAN 10</strong> is assigned to the <strong>Accounts Department</strong>, which consists of <strong>59 devices</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>subnet</strong> allocated for this department is <strong>192.168.200.0/25</strong>, providing <strong>126 usable IP addresses</strong>. This allows for the required 59 devices while leaving room for future growth.</li>
<li>The range of IP addresses for this department will be from <strong>192.168.200.1 to 192.168.200.126</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="administrator-69-devices"><strong>Administrator: 69 Devices</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>VLAN 20</strong> is assigned to the <strong>Administrator Department</strong>, which consists of <strong>69 devices</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>subnet</strong> allocated for this department is <strong>192.168.200.128/25</strong>, which also provides <strong>126 usable IP addresses</strong>.</li>
<li>The range of IP addresses for this department will be from <strong>192.168.200.129 to 192.168.200.254</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="marketing-119-devices"><strong>Marketing: 119 Devices</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>VLAN 30</strong> is assigned to the <strong>Marketing Department</strong>, with a total of <strong>119 devices</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>subnet</strong> allocated for this department is <strong>192.168.201.0/25</strong>, providing <strong>126 usable IP addresses</strong>, which meets the current requirement of 119 devices and leaves room for minor expansion.</li>
<li>The IP address range for this department will be from <strong>192.168.201.1 to 192.168.201.126</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sales-249-devices"><strong>Sales: 249 Devices</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>VLAN 40</strong> is assigned to the <strong>Sales Department</strong>, which consists of <strong>249 devices</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>subnet</strong> allocated for this department is <strong>192.168.201.128/24</strong>, which provides <strong>256 usable IP addresses</strong>, more than sufficient to accommodate the 249 devices.</li>
<li>The range of IP addresses for the Sales department will be from <strong>192.168.201.129 to 192.168.202.254</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-of-ip-allocation"><strong>Summary of IP Allocation</strong></h3>
<p>The table below summarizes the IP allocation for each department, ensuring that each has enough address space to meet current and future needs:</p>

<p>Here’s a draft for the <strong>Network Topology</strong> section of your report:</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you for sharing the updated network diagram that utilizes a <strong>two-tier architecture</strong>. Based on this, I will modify the <strong>Network Topology</strong> section to reflect the two-tier architecture instead of the previously mentioned three-tier hierarchical model.</p>
<p>Here is the updated section:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-network-topology"><strong>3. Network Topology</strong></h2>
<h3 id="design-considerations"><strong>Design Considerations</strong></h3>
<p>The design is based on a <strong>two-tier architecture</strong>, which combines the functionality of the <strong>core and distribution layers</strong> into a single layer while maintaining a separate <strong>access layer</strong>. This approach simplifies the network, reduces complexity, and offers a more cost-effective and efficient design, especially for medium-sized networks. The following considerations were taken into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplification of Architecture</strong>: The <strong>two-tier architecture</strong> eliminates the need for a separate distribution layer, making the network more straightforward while still maintaining efficient routing, security, and scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: The two-tier model allows for easy expansion by adding more access layer switches and devices as needed. The network can support the current number of devices and can easily be scaled up for future growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segmentation and Security</strong>: Each department is assigned its own <strong>VLAN</strong>, isolating traffic and ensuring that each department’s network traffic remains secure and manageable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: The core layer is responsible for routing between VLANs, while the access layer connects end devices to the network. This separation allows for optimized performance and better traffic management, reducing bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundancy</strong>: The core layer ensures redundancy through high-speed links, preventing single points of failure. Trunk links between switches ensure that VLAN traffic can flow between departments without disruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: By combining the core and distribution layers into one, the design reduces the number of devices needed, making it more cost-effective without sacrificing performance or scalability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="network-layout-and-structure-with-diagrams"><strong>Network Layout and Structure (with Diagrams)</strong></h3>
<p>The network follows a <strong>two-tier architecture</strong> model, with two layers: the <strong>core layer</strong> (which combines core and distribution functions) and the <strong>access layer</strong>. The <strong>core layer switch</strong> handles inter-VLAN routing, high-speed traffic forwarding, and traffic aggregation from the access layer switches.</p>
<h4 id="core-layer"><strong>Core Layer</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>core layer</strong> is responsible for high-speed data transfer and inter-VLAN routing across departments. It aggregates traffic from all access layer switches and ensures that traffic is forwarded efficiently across the network.</li>
<li>The core layer switch also handles inter-department and inter-branch traffic, ensuring that VLANs are properly routed and that policies such as QoS and ACLs are enforced.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="access-layer"><strong>Access Layer</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>access layer</strong> connects end devices, such as PCs, printers, and phones, to the network. Each access layer switch is assigned a specific VLAN for each department (Accounts, Administrator, Marketing, and Sales).</li>
<li>The access switches forward VLAN traffic to the core switch, where inter-VLAN routing is handled. Trunk links are used between the access and core switches to allow multiple VLANs to pass through a single physical connection.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="diagram-two-tier-network-topology"><strong>Diagram: Two-Tier Network Topology</strong></h4>
<p>Below is a visual representation of the network’s <strong>two-tier architecture</strong>. The diagram illustrates how the core switch handles both routing and aggregation while access switches connect directly to end devices within each department.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>[Insert your updated network diagram here]</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="device-and-hardware-specifications"><strong>Device and Hardware Specifications</strong></h3>

<p>This updated <strong>Network Topology</strong> section reflects the <strong>two-tier architecture</strong> you have implemented, explaining how the network is structured with the core and access layers, and detailing the device and hardware specifications used. This design provides a balance of simplicity, scalability, and efficiency, making it suitable for your network requirements.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional details!</p>
<h3 id="design-considerations"><strong>Design Considerations</strong></h3>
<p>The design of the network is centered around providing a secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure to support the organization's communication needs. The following considerations were taken into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: The network is designed to accommodate the current number of devices with room for future growth. The IP addressing scheme allows for the addition of new devices in each department without requiring significant changes to the network architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Using <strong>Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)</strong> to segment traffic by department ensures that each department’s traffic remains isolated, improving both security and performance. This allows better control of broadcast domains and improves overall network efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Each department is allocated its own VLAN, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access between departments. <strong>Inter-VLAN routing</strong> is handled by a Layer 3 switch, ensuring that traffic between VLANs is managed securely with access control lists (ACLs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundancy</strong>: The core of the network uses <strong>redundant links</strong> to prevent a single point of failure, improving network uptime and availability. Redundancy is built into the connections between distribution and core layers to ensure smooth operations in case of a failure in any one link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: The network is designed with separate <strong>core, distribution, and access layers</strong> to optimize performance and manage traffic efficiently. <strong>Trunk links</strong> are used between switches to carry multiple VLAN traffic and ensure seamless communication between different parts of the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of Management</strong>: The hierarchical model (core, distribution, access) simplifies network management. Each layer has a defined role, which makes troubleshooting easier and allows for network changes without affecting the entire infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="network-layout-and-structure-with-diagrams"><strong>Network Layout and Structure (with Diagrams)</strong></h3>
<p>The network is structured following a <strong>three-layer hierarchical model</strong>, which includes the <strong>core layer</strong>, <strong>distribution layer</strong>, and <strong>access layer</strong>. This design provides a modular and flexible architecture that supports both performance and scalability.</p>
<h4 id="core-layer"><strong>Core Layer</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>core layer</strong> acts as the backbone of the network and is responsible for high-speed data transfer between different distribution switches. It connects the distribution switches of all branches and departments, ensuring fast routing of data across the network.</li>
<li>The <strong>core switch</strong> used is the <strong>Cisco Catalyst 3650</strong>, a high-performance Layer 3 switch that handles inter-VLAN routing and traffic forwarding between branches and departments.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="distribution-layer"><strong>Distribution Layer</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>distribution layer</strong> aggregates traffic from the access layer switches and forwards it to the core. This layer is responsible for <strong>routing between VLANs</strong> and applying network policies such as quality of service (QoS) and security measures.</li>
<li><strong>Cisco Catalyst 3560</strong> switches are used at the distribution layer to provide routing and policy enforcement between VLANs. These switches are connected to the core switch via high-speed <strong>trunk links</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="access-layer"><strong>Access Layer</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>access layer</strong> consists of switches that connect directly to end devices such as computers, printers, and phones. These switches handle VLAN assignments and provide connectivity for end users in the departments.</li>
<li><strong>Cisco Catalyst 2960</strong> switches are used at the access layer, where each department is assigned its own VLAN. The access switches are connected to the distribution switches via trunk links that carry VLAN traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="diagram-hierarchical-network-topology"><strong>Diagram: Hierarchical Network Topology</strong></h4>
<p>Below is a simplified representation of the network topology, structured using the core, distribution, and access layers. The diagram illustrates how VLANs are distributed across the departments and how the switches are interconnected.</p>

<h3 id="setup-in-cisco-packet-tracer"><strong>Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer</strong></h3>
<p>The network simulation for this project was created using <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong>, a simulation tool used for network configuration and testing. The network was designed based on a <strong>two-tier architecture</strong>, with a <strong>core switch</strong> responsible for inter-VLAN routing and multiple <strong>access layer switches</strong> handling department-specific VLAN traffic.</p>
<p>The following devices were used in the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cisco Catalyst 3650</strong> (Core Switch)</li>
<li><strong>Cisco Catalyst 2960</strong> (Access Layer Switches)</li>
<li><strong>DHCP Server</strong></li>
<li><strong>End devices</strong>: PCs, printers, phones, and other department-specific devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network design in Cisco Packet Tracer includes multiple <strong>VLANs</strong> to segment the network traffic for each department. VLANs are configured on both the core and access layer switches to ensure traffic isolation. Each department is connected to the network using their respective <strong>VLANs</strong>, and <strong>DHCP</strong> is used for automatic IP address assignment.</p>

<h2 id="7-demonstration-and-presentation"><strong>7. Demonstration and Presentation</strong></h2>
<h3 id="explanation-of-the-working-solution"><strong>Explanation of the Working Solution</strong></h3>
<p>The network simulation designed for this project was successfully implemented using <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong> and follows a <strong>two-tier architecture</strong> model. The core switch handles inter-VLAN routing while access layer switches segment departmental traffic using VLANs.</p>
<h4 id="overview-of-the-working-solution"><strong>Overview of the Working Solution</strong></h4>
<p>The primary goal of the network was to segment traffic for different departments (Accounts, Administration, Marketing, and Sales) using <strong>VLANs</strong> and to route traffic between these VLANs using a <strong>Layer 3 switch (Core Switch)</strong>. The solution ensures that all devices can communicate efficiently within their own VLAN and across VLANs when necessary, while also maintaining security and performance.</p>
<p>The network was configured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VLAN Segmentation</strong>: Each department is assigned its own VLAN, ensuring isolated network traffic for each department.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-VLAN Routing</strong>: The core switch (Cisco 3650) is responsible for routing traffic between VLANs using <strong>Layer 3 routing capabilities</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Trunking</strong>: Trunk links are established between the core and access switches, allowing multiple VLANs to pass over a single physical connection.</li>
<li><strong>DHCP Configuration</strong>: A DHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses to end devices in each VLAN, ensuring that devices automatically receive an IP address from their respective VLAN’s IP range.</li>
<li><strong>HSRP and Redundancy</strong>: <strong>HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)</strong> is configured on the core switch to provide network redundancy. This ensures that in the event of a failure, another standby router takes over and prevents network downtime.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="working-solution-in-action"><strong>Working Solution in Action</strong></h4>
<p>The working solution was tested and verified by performing several tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intra-VLAN Communication</strong>: Devices within the same VLAN can communicate with each other without issues. For instance, all PCs in the <strong>Accounts department</strong> (VLAN 10) can communicate seamlessly.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-VLAN Routing</strong>: Devices from different VLANs, such as a PC in the <strong>Sales department (VLAN 40)</strong> and a PC in the <strong>Marketing department (VLAN 30)</strong>, are able to communicate across VLANs through the core switch, demonstrating the success of the routing configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic IP Address Assignment</strong>: All devices in the network receive IP addresses automatically from the <strong>DHCP server</strong>, ensuring that IP address management is efficient and automated.</li>
<li><strong>Network Redundancy</strong>: In case of a network link failure, redundant links automatically take over, ensuring continued communication without downtime. This was demonstrated by simulating a failure in one of the core switch connections, after which traffic continued to flow through an alternate route.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network setup is flexible, scalable, and ready for future growth, ensuring that additional devices or departments can be added without requiring significant changes to the existing network design.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="key-features-and-functionality-demonstrated"><strong>Key Features and Functionality Demonstrated</strong></h3>
<h4 id="1-vlan-segmentation"><strong>1. VLAN Segmentation</strong></h4>

<h2 id="8-challenges-and-solutions"><strong>8. Challenges and Solutions</strong></h2>
<h3 id="issues-faced-during-simulation"><strong>Issues Faced During Simulation</strong></h3>
<p>During the design and implementation of the network in <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer</strong>, several challenges were encountered. These issues primarily related to configuring VLANs, ensuring inter-VLAN routing, establishing redundancy for network resilience, and correctly implementing security protocols. Below are the key challenges and the corresponding solutions that were applied to resolve them.</p>
<h4 id="1-vlan-trunking-issues"><strong>1. VLAN Trunking Issues</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Initially, trunk links between the core switch (Cisco 3650) and the access layer switches (Cisco 2960) were not allowing multiple VLAN traffic to pass. This led to devices in different VLANs being unable to communicate with each other, even though VLANs were configured correctly on both the core and access switches.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: The <strong>trunk mode</strong> was not properly configured, which prevented the switches from forwarding traffic for multiple VLANs. Additionally, the allowed VLANs were not explicitly defined on the trunk ports, resulting in untagged traffic being dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: The trunk ports were manually configured to allow the required VLANs to pass between the switches. This was done using the following commands on the core and access switches:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>interface gi0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40
<span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>
</div></code></pre>
This configuration enabled traffic from multiple VLANs to pass through the trunk links and allowed inter-VLAN communication.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-inter-vlan-routing-challenges"><strong>2. Inter-VLAN Routing Challenges</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Devices from different VLANs were unable to communicate with each other, even though inter-VLAN routing was enabled on the core switch.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: The <strong>VLAN interfaces</strong> (SVIs) on the core switch were not properly configured with IP addresses, preventing the switch from acting as a router for the different VLANs.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Each VLAN was assigned a <strong>Switched Virtual Interface (SVI)</strong> with an IP address to act as the default gateway for that VLAN. Once the SVIs were configured and routing was enabled, inter-VLAN communication worked as expected.
Example configuration:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>interface vlan 10
ip address 192.168.200.1 255.255.255.128
no shutdown

interface vlan 20
ip address 192.168.200.129 255.255.255.128
no shutdown
</div></code></pre>
Additionally, <strong>IP routing</strong> was enabled on the core switch:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ip routing
</div></code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-dhcp-server-not-assigning-ip-addresses"><strong>3. DHCP Server Not Assigning IP Addresses</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Devices connected to the network were not receiving IP addresses from the DHCP server. This caused manual IP configuration to be necessary, which was not ideal for scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: The <strong>DHCP pools</strong> were either not correctly configured, or the VLAN interfaces did not have the correct default gateway settings for the devices to communicate with the DHCP server.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: The DHCP pools were configured on the server to provide IP addresses specific to each VLAN’s subnet. The correct <strong>default gateway</strong> was also set for each VLAN on the core switch, ensuring that devices could reach the DHCP server.
Example configuration for a VLAN 10 DHCP pool:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ip dhcp pool VLAN10
network 192.168.200.0 255.255.255.128
default-router 192.168.200.1
dns-server 10.1.1.37
</div></code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-redundancy-and-failover-issues"><strong>4. Redundancy and Failover Issues</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: The network lacked redundancy, meaning that if a core switch or trunk link failed, there would be no failover mechanism, leading to network downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: The network initially did not have a backup or failover configuration for the core switch or the trunk links, which could lead to single points of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: <strong>HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)</strong> was implemented on the core switch to provide high availability. This protocol allowed for an automatic failover to a backup router if the primary router became unavailable.
Configuration example for HSRP:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>interface vlan 10
ip address 192.168.200.1 255.255.255.128
standby 10 ip 192.168.200.254
standby 10 priority 110
standby 10 preempt
<span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>
</div></code></pre>
Additionally, <strong>EtherChannel</strong> using <strong>LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)</strong> was configured between the core and access switches to bundle multiple links and provide redundancy in case one link failed:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40
</div></code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-security-and-vlan-hopping-prevention"><strong>5. Security and VLAN Hopping Prevention</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: There was a concern about <strong>VLAN hopping</strong>, where an attacker could send frames to unauthorized VLANs by exploiting a misconfigured trunk port.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: Trunk ports were left open to all VLAN traffic by default, and no security measures like <strong>BPDU Guard</strong> or <strong>PortFast</strong> were configured to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: <strong>VLAN hopping prevention</strong> was implemented by limiting the allowed VLANs on each trunk port and configuring <strong>PortFast</strong> and <strong>BPDU Guard</strong> on access ports.
Example configuration:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>interface gi0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40
<span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>

interface range fa0/1 - 24
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard <span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span>
</div></code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-wireless-infrastructure-setup"><strong>6. Wireless Infrastructure Setup</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: The wireless network, managed by the <strong>Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)</strong>, was initially not allowing proper connectivity for wireless devices across the VLANs.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: The Wireless Access Points (LAPs) were not correctly associated with the WLC, and the <strong>VLAN mappings</strong> for wireless traffic were not properly configured.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: The Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) was properly configured to handle traffic for specific VLANs. Each department's VLAN was mapped to a specific SSID for wireless clients, and the LAPs were successfully associated with the WLC.
Example VLAN mapping for wireless clients:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>wlan AccountsSSID 10
vlan 10
</div></code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7-voip-configuration-issues"><strong>7. VoIP Configuration Issues</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: The <strong>Cisco Voice Gateway</strong> and IP phones initially experienced connectivity issues, leading to dropped calls and unavailable VoIP services.</li>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: <strong>VLAN 70</strong> for VoIP traffic was not properly configured on the access and core switches, and the Voice Gateway’s connection to the switches was not prioritized.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: VLAN 70 was created for VoIP traffic, and <strong>QoS (Quality of Service)</strong> settings were applied to ensure that VoIP traffic received higher priority over other data traffic. The Voice Gateway was placed in VLAN 70, and the IP phones were correctly configured to use this VLAN.
Example configuration:<pre class="hljs"><code><div>vlan 70
name VoIP

interface gi0/1
switchport access vlan 70
mls qos trust cos
</div></code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
